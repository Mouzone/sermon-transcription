# Frontend

This directory contains the Next.js frontend for the Sermon Scraper & Transcriber project.

## üß∞ Stack
- TypeScript
- Next.js
- React Server Components
- PostgREST (via Supabase)
- Tailwind CSS

## ‚öôÔ∏è Methodology
- The frontend is deployed on [Vercel](https://sermon-transcription.vercel.app/).
- It fetches and displays the latest sermon that has been transcribed and outlined by the backend.
- It uses React Server Components to:
  - Simplify data fetching from Supabase using one-liner PostgREST queries.
  - Enhance performance by rendering on the server and avoiding unnecessary client-side JavaScript, which helps in eliminating the need for complex state management for loading states (e.g., spinners).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Ensure you have Node.js and npm (or yarn/pnpm/bun) installed.
- No specific environment variables are required to run the frontend in development mode, as it fetches data from the publicly accessible Supabase API. However, for building or specific configurations, you might need to refer to Next.js documentation.

### Running Locally
1. Navigate to the `frontend` directory.
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   # or
   pnpm install
   # or
   bun install
   ```
3. Run the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # or
   yarn dev
   # or
   pnpm dev
   # or
   bun dev
   ```
4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a font family for Vercel.
