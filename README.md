# Backend

## 🧰 Stack
- `uv` (package manager)
- Python
- Docker

## ⚙️ Methodology
1. Scrapes the [YouTube livestreams page of Arumdaum EM](https://www.youtube.com/@ArumdaumEM/live) to find the latest sermon's title and YouTube link.
2. Downloads the sermon into a folder named `sermons`.
3. Sends the video file to AssemblyAI for transcription.
4. Passes the transcription to Google's Gemini 2.0 Flash model to:
   - Split into logical sections
   - Edit for readability
5. Uploads the original transcription and the sectioned version to a Supabase database via PostgREST.
6. Deletes the downloaded video file to clean up.

## 🐳 Docker
- Dockerized to run on Google Cloud with Cloud Scheduler for daily automation.
- Uses `uv` inside the Docker container for dependency installation.
- Installs Chrome in the container so Selenium can scrape properly.
- Creates a `sermons` folder in the container to store the downloaded YouTube video file.

## ▶️ Run Instructions
- Requires a `.env` file with the following credentials:
  - AssemblyAI API key
  - Gemini API key
  - Supabase database URL and key
- Can be run:
  - Locally as a Docker container
  - Directly with `uv run main.py`
- ⚠️ Google Cloud Run’s IPs are often blacklisted from downloading YouTube videos (due to being datacenter IPs). Running locally may be necessary.

# Frontend

## 🧰 Stack
- TypeScript
- Next.js
- React Server Components
- PostgREST (via Supabase)
- Tailwind CSS

## ⚙️ Methodology
- Deployed on [Vercel](https://vercel.com)
- Fetches the latest sermon that has been transcribed and outlined by the backend.
- Uses React Server Components to:
  - Simplify fetching using one-liner PostgREST queries
  - Avoid extra complexity (e.g., loading spinners)
